Soil microbiome plays a crucial role in the functionality of an ecosystem. This organism has been overlooked in the past conservation efforts. There is an increasing recognition of the importance of this organism. There are efforts to increase the visibility of fungal species. However, some regions might be underrepresented in some regions. Here, a simple data analysis program was created to identify which Southeast Asian countries that are not yet represented in Global Soil Mycobiome consortium (GSMc) dataset, one of the open fungal diversity research datasets. 
The dataset could be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.15156/BIO/2263453
The dataset should be stored within the same folder as the notebook so user does not need to set the directory. See documentation file for reference on how the code works.
